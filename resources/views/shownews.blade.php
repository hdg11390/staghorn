                    We continue to enjoy shows, both here in Canada and throughout the United States. Staghorn is always well represented and enjoy a respectable outcome. Linda has continued to judge Sweepstakes at Labrador Specialties and has truly enjoyed the honour of being asked to do so by the clubs. I have enjoyed travelling to Winnipeg, Edmonton, New York State as well as several Ontario locations.

                    I'm proud of all my dogs and couldn't be happier with the direction we've taken in our breeding program here at Staghorn. Win or lose, I am always happiest that I am taking the dog home that I am. There’s an old saying that says “everyone thinks their dog is the best. And no one is wrong
