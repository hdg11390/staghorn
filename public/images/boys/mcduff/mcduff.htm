This canvasback dummy is about 28 years old, and belonged to  my late father and his &quot;prize&quot; black male Duke, who went back to Wimberway lines. Only because McDuff is so soft mouthed is he permitted to retrieve this dummy. He seems to know how special it is. He finds it among all the newer ones and this is the one he wants to use. My dad would have been very proud of McDuff.</td>

<div class="style2"> This handsome Mac &amp; Patty son is another great pride and joy of Staghorn. He is all we ever could have hoped for. He finished his championship easily (breeder/owner handled) after placing as a puppy at several Labrador Specialty shows.<br>
<br>
McDuff is USA pointed, having won Best of Breed, (breeder/owner handled) from the classes at the Leatherstocking Cluster in Syracuse, N.Y, Best of Opposite to the lovely Tabatha's Pristine, (over male specials) in Buffalo and Winners Dog at Hamburg.<br>
<br>
McDuff is  easy to live with,  very soft mouthed and good natured. He is a joy to have in the house. Like his sire, he has excellent black pigment, is compact and well balanced with  a very nice nice headpiece, a heavy double coat, light creme in colour. He is loaded in bone and substance, yet is very &quot;together&quot; and agile. He's a fun dog to have around, loves people and dogs alike, (especially girls!) I get very nice comments on his looks and structure. He's consistently produces very nice pups with exceptional bone, coat, head and pigment. (<a href="../../annie.htm" class="style12">See Annie's page</a>) and some of his kids in the Hall of Fame section. He is available at stud to approved bitches with suitable clearances.<br>
