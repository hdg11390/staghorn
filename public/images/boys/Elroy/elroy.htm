  <p class="style2">Elroy is an absolutely wonderful male who is everything we could hope for. He excells at conformation, obedience, field, tracking, etc. This boy has it ALL, as his titles before and after his his name indicate. (See below for just some of his wonderful achievements).  Beyond all of his successes, the best part about this boy is his absolutely fantastic temperament and his complete common sense. He has just began his career as a stud dog and is available to approved females with suitable clearances. For further information regarding Elroy, please contact his owner, Marie P. Babin at  <a href="mailto:autumwynd@eastlink.ca">autumwynd@eastlink.ca</a></p>
