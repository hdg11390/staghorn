    <p class="style2">We can't imagine where the years have gone. Seems like yesterday we were thrilled to announce that we had a new, very handsome, American and Canadian Champion male who had joined the gang here at Staghorn. Snoopy, affectionately  called Snoop Dog by our family, has been the most gentle, loving tail wagging kind soul there ever was in the Labrador world. At 13 years old, he is now neutered and retired and sleeps every night at my side and shows me his undying love and his gratitude for my decision to own him. He is the epitomy of a big old loveable yellow Lab and my life is richer for having shared it with him. Snoopy has always  treated every day here at Staghorn as a whole new opportunity for fun. He is an exceptionally clean dog with excellent house manners and has always been very easy to live with. He barely spent a night in our kennel and quickly won his way into our home and our hearts. At almost 13 years of age he developed an absess of the prostate, (old age related) and we came close to losing him but after much TLC he rallied and we later had him neutered. He celebrated his  13th birthday in July and he's healthy and well and continues to enjoy his retirement with us as an amazing family member, loved by us, our kids and grandkids, as well as his harem of females. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="style2"> In his showing career, he showed under 5 major judges in the USA and finished on FIVE majors. He received a Judges Award of Merit at the prestigious Potomac Labrador Specialty, and the Greater Boston Specialties, in 2005. His get have been in the ribbons at the Potomac and other fine American specialties as well. </p>
