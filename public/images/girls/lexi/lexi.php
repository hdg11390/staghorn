	 	 We are  extremely proud of our lovely Heidi X Fez daughter, Lexi. She is such an all  round Labrador. Under the excellent training and care of her Auntie Kim and Uncle Geoff, she easily attained her Championship,  including a wonderful specialty win at the Eastern Ontario Labrador Breeder's  Association show, which finished her in grand style. Earlier, with Kim as well, she attained her  Canine Good Neighbour title and had had training in both  obedience and field work. Kim's training and efforts are clearly visible in Lexi at obedience classes. Thank you and Kudos Kim!</p>
  		 <p class="style2">Lexi has lovely form and yet is just feminine enough  and not overdone for a female. She's everything we strive to produce - head,  topline, tail, coat, brains and sweet, sweet temperament like her mother, our  special Heidi. Staghorn is very proud to have  Lexi in our breeding program, with her temperament,  trainability and structural soundness/health clearances.</p>
