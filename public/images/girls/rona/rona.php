	 	Rona is the happiest, most non assuming girlie ever. As showing didn't seem to be her cup of tea, we let her excel at being the belle of the ball at Staghorn. She's the best of both her parents in a nice black fur coat. Just a joy to have bred and to own. So giving and loving and while she doesn't care for being stacked or handled, she really is a beautiful girl and is structurally very, very nice!</p>
