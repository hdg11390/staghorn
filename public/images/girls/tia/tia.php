	 	 Tia is a wonderful addition to our breeding program. Bred by my dear friend, Lori Riley, of Connecticut, Tia came to us as a baby and we have enjoyed every minute of her time with us. She is the epitome of what Breeders strive to produce, head, topline, tail, coat, eye colour, and such wonderful temperament! She is very well put together and comes from a remarkable pedigree. She's a joy to live with and I can't thank Lori enough for this wonderful girlie.</p>
