	 	 We kept a darling yellow girl from Am Ch Ledgewood's Radar X Madabout's Adieu to Staghorn's. Her call name is Emmy, which is really "M.E", for Mary Ellen Bittlinger, who, along with her husband, was very kind and hospitable to us when we went to Buffalo for the breeding. Our little keeper gal reminds us every day of Mary Ellen's kindness and wonderful personality. She's a little spitfire, full of fun and love. We took her to the National and Regional shows in Quebec in June/12. She was in the ribbons in both specialties and sweeps. Emmy is full of P&V and makes Momma work hard for those ribbons, but we love her to pieces!</p>
