	 	 <p>Miss Moxie shows us a great deal of promise. Smart as a whip and full of moxie, she's a showboat of energy and fun. Her happy and eager-to-please temperament reminds us daily of her sweet mother, Portabella, who now adorns the chesterfield of her new mom Noreen. Moxie actually adorns the chesterfield of my good friends Robin and Paul, with our Erma. Erma is retired but Moxie will return to Staghorn for a few litters, but enjoy life with her other family in the meantime. She is a remarkable girl with excellent clearances and we love her to pieces.</p>
